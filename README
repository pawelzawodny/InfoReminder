   ./scripts/prepare_setup_builder_environment.sh PATH_TO_DESKTOP_APPLICATION PATH_TO_INSTALL_CREATOR

   where PATH_TO_DESKTOP_APPLICATION is directory where you store desktop app sources
   and PATH_TO_INSTALL_CREATOR is directory where you installed "Install Creator"
5. Your build service is ready, you can verify it's working by running web application and choosing "Download" link.

6. Edit file "lib/setup/config/config.yml" located in web application directory
7. Change all paths to windows style paths and change paths to ic, tmp, template and destination
8. Change root_drive to ''
9. Your build service should be ready now, you can verify it's working by running web application and choosing "Download" link.

IV. Thoughts and ideas
We should get a nice domain i.e. inforeminder.com, remind.info, remind.me, notify.me, reminder.com, reminder.info

We should create International version localised according to user location.

Each step/decision for users should be presented as big image with short description
i.e. User could decide whether he wants to display notifications on each computer separately or once (By providing one URL do desktop application)
