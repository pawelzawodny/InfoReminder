4. Thoughts and ideas
We should get a nice domain i.e. inforeminder.com, remind.info, remind.me, notify.me, reminder.com, reminder.info

We should create International version localised according to user location.

Each step/decision for users should be presented as big image with short description
i.e. User could decide whether he wants to display notifications on each computer separately or once (By providing one URL do desktop application)
